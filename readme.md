# Fachprojekt Data Mining and Data Analysis
Use this repository to collaborate with your team members.
In this repository you'll find an almost empty jupyter notebook. So far it loads the data provided at moodle and shows some examples. You can use this notebook as a starting point for your future work, but you can also start from scratch. 
To launch the notebook, activate your conda environment and just type `jupyter notebook`. A browser window should open; now you can open `fp.ipynb`.
